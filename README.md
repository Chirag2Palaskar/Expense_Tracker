# Expense_Tracker
HELLO THERE!
Welcome to the Expense Tracker!
Managing finances is an essential skill that we all need but often struggle to develop. As a first-year B.Tech student, I realised the importance of tracking expenses when I started managing my monthly allowance. To simplify this task, I decided to create a console-based Expense Tracker using C programming. This project was not only a fun exercise in programming but also a practical tool for managing my expenses. Here, Iâ€™ll walk you through the details of the project, its features, the code structure, and what I learned along the way.

People worked on this project are:
1. Atharva Wanjale
2. Chinmay Palaskar
3. Sarvesh Khaladkar
4. Soham Godbole
